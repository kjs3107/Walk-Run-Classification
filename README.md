## Overview

Welcome to the WalkRun Classification project! This machine learning model predicts whether a given set of motion data corresponds to walking or running. The model uses [insert machine learning framework/library] for accurate and efficient classification.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access and use the data.

  ![Training Data](C:\Users\HP\Downloads\AI-ML PROJECT\Data)

- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.

- **`src/`**: Source code for the machine learning model.

- **`models/`**: Saved model files after training.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/walkrun-classification.git
    cd walkrun-classification
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Data Preparation

- Ensure that your dataset is placed in the `data/` directory.

### Model Training

- Run the training script to train the model:

    ```bash
    python src/train.py
    ```

- The trained model will be saved in the `models/` directory.

### Model Evaluation

- Use the evaluation script to assess the model performance:

    ```bash
    python src/evaluate.py
    ```

### Inference

- Apply the trained model for inference on new data:

    ```bash
    python src/inference.py --input <path/to/new/data.csv>
    ```
